# ApplicationTracker
Creating an android application to keep track of job and internship applications.
Android application is mainly going to be used as the client side to view the job applications that I have currently applied to.
The Application Tracker server side is a python script that is run in the terminal, to reduce start up time when using a GUI, which will be the main way of adding new applications to the database.

# ApplicationTracker
<p>Creating an android application to keep track of job and internship applications.
Android application is mainly going to be used as the client side to view the job applications that I have currently applied to.
The Application Tracker server side is a python script that is run in the terminal, to reduce start up time when using a GUI, which will be the main way of adding new applications to the database.<p>
